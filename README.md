# Bulk Manager

This package allows to use bulk in each operation with the following features:

- executed repeatedly 
- execution method is always the same
- multiple operations can be executed joint
- the single operation must not be executed immediately but with a maximum delay time
- the operations are performed keeping the initial order

These features appear restrictive but there are some operations in the normal programs that fall into these.

In this repository there are two simple examples of this wide type of operations:

1. Logs
2. Api with always the same structure
